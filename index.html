    <h1>How I Got Into Gaming</h1>
    <h2>First Arcades</h2>
    <p>In the 90s, when I was a young man, either with my family or with my school we went to visit local cinema. Usually in a cinema you watch a movie or perhaps buy popcorn and drinks. But that cinema had something more, namely arcades. That was my initiation to video games.</p>
    <p>The arcades that were available at the cinema adn I remember by name were Tenage mutant Turtles (not sure what version) and Pit Fighter. There were at least 5 arcades and perhaps some flippers. At that time we began going to the cinema with my elementary school friends.</p>
    <h2>First Console</h2>
    <p>Later my mother bought me Pegasus (local version of NES) and I began playing at home with friends.</p>
    <h2>Downtown</h2>
    <p>In later grades we began going to a fast food place downtown. There was an arcades section, and we played Mortal Kombat there. But there was another game there with some crowd of people standing around. It was also a fighter but with 'square man', as we called it. That's how we discovered Virtua Fighter.</p>
    <h2>First Computer</h2>
    <p>Few years later my father gave me my first PC. There I played more PC games like RTS (Real Time Strategy) and RPG (Roleplaying) games. I also experimented with emulation and played some SNES games I never has opportunity to play, as SNES was either unavailable or expensive in my country.</p>
    <h2>Second Console</h2>
    <p>A little bit later I bought Dreamcast and a newer PC. That was probably the golden age of my gaming.</p>
    <h2>Later in life</h2>
    <p>Later I continued playing but not every day. Today I play mostly Starcraft II. But games today are not as exciting as they were in the 90s.</p>
