    <h1>Chrono Trigger</h1>
    <p>Chrono Trigger is one of the best video games I have ever played.</p>
    <h2>How Did I Get Into This?</h2>
    <p>Well, not sure. I've set up snes9x on my computer and was emulating SNES games. Did I search for best SNES games or SNES RPSs and found it that way? Possible, but unlikely, because, and that may sound strange, but googling things for everything was not as common as you would think.
        Perhaps I just found it on a website I downloaded emulators from...</p>
    <h2>What Actually Chrono Trigger is?</h2>
    <p>It is an JRPG game (Japanese Roleplaying Game). Why 'Japanese'? Because PC RPGs like Baldurs Gate or Fallout or even Diablo were very different from RPG made in Japan for consoles. I'm not sure how to put it but JRPGs had more manga like characters, they were always about saving the whole world, 2D (at least till Final Fantasy VII) graphics that weren't supposed to look natural, different battle system. PC RPGs were an evolution of pen and paper systems like D&amp;D. Simply different vibe.</p>
    <p>In Chrono Trigger you begin by meeting a girl and helping her find her pendant and you end up time traveling and saving the world. The battle system is great, story is amazing and music is out of this world.</p>
